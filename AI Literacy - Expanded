## 🔑 Quick Reference (Most Important Terms)

Think of this section as your **flashcards**. If you only remember these, you’ll have the big picture.  

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** – Teaching machines to mimic human thinking and decision-making.  
- **Machine Learning (ML)** – Teaching machines to **learn from data** instead of just following rules.  
- **Deep Learning (DL)** – A type of ML that uses **neural networks with many layers** (like a digital brain).  
- **Generative AI (GenAI)** – AI that can **create new things** (text, images, music, etc.).  
- **Transformers** – A model architecture that lets AI **understand context and relationships in data** (the engine behind GPT).  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** – Very large transformer models trained on text.  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Writing good instructions for AI to get better results.  
- **Zero-Shot / Few-Shot Learning** – AI can do tasks with **no examples (zero)** or **just a few examples (few)**.  
- **Fine-Tuning** – Adjusting a pre-trained AI model for a **specific task or industry**.  
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting** – Asking AI to **show its reasoning step by step**.  
- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback)** – Teaching AI by combining machine learning with **human corrections**.  
- **Responsible AI** – Making sure AI is **fair, safe, and ethical**.

## 📖 Lesson-by-Lesson Guide

### Lesson 01 – Overview of AI, ML, and DL
AI is the umbrella, ML is the tool, and DL is the powerhouse.  

**Key Ideas**
- **AI** = Broad concept: anything where computers act “smart.”  
- **ML** = Subset: systems that **learn patterns from data**.  
- **DL** = Subset of ML: **neural networks with many layers** learn complex patterns.  

**Types of Learning**
- *Supervised*: You give the machine labeled examples (“this is a cat”).  
- *Unsupervised*: Machine finds its own patterns (grouping similar data).  
- *Reinforcement*: Machine learns by trial and error (like training a dog with rewards).  

💡 *Connection*: Reinforcement learning shows up again in **RLHF (Lesson 04)**.  

---

### Lesson 02 – Transformers, Advanced AI Models, and NLP
Transformers made LLMs possible.  

**Key Ideas**
- **Transformers**: Instead of processing words one at a time, they look at the **whole sentence at once** → faster and more accurate.  
- **Attention Mechanism**: Helps the model figure out **which words matter most** in context.  
- **Embeddings**: Turning words into numbers so the AI can work with them.  
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: How computers work with human language.  

💡 *Connection*: Transformers power **GPTs (Lesson 04)**.  

---

### Lesson 03 – Generative AI and AI Project Implementation
Now we move from “understanding” language to **creating** things.  

**Key Ideas**
- **Generative AI (GenAI)**: Makes new content — text (ChatGPT), images (DALL·E), music, and more.  
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: Two AIs competing — one generates, one critiques.  
- **Diffusion Models**: Step-by-step process that turns noise into images.  
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Humans guide AI to keep it useful and safe.  
- **Responsible AI**: Avoid bias, ensure fairness, explain decisions.  

💡 *Connection*: Ethical ideas here continue into **Safety & Alignment (Lesson 04)**.  

---

### Lesson 04 – Working with GPTs
Hands-on with the AI you’ve been hearing about.  

**Key Ideas**
- **GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer)**: Trained on huge amounts of text to **predict the next word** in a sequence.  
- **Prompt Engineering**: How you ask the question changes the answer.  
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: “Show your work” → better reasoning.  
- **Zero-Shot / Few-Shot Learning**: GPT can do tasks without retraining.  
- **Fine-Tuning**: Customizing GPT for your company/industry.  
- **RLHF**: Aligns AI with human values and feedback.  
- **Safety & Alignment**: Keeping AI helpful, harmless, and honest.  

💡 *Connection*: Combines **Transformers (Lesson 02)** + **Reinforcement Learning (Lesson 01)** + **Responsible AI (Lesson 03)**.

## 📚 Drill-Down Study Notes

### Lesson 01
- Think of AI as the **big circle**, ML as a **smaller circle inside**, and DL as an **even smaller circle inside ML**.  
- Real-world: Spam filters = ML; Siri = AI + NLP; Self-driving cars = AI + DL.  

### Lesson 02
- “Attention” is like highlighting the important words in a sentence.  
- BERT vs. GPT: BERT reads both directions (good for understanding); GPT reads left-to-right (good for generating).  

### Lesson 03
- GANs: Think of a **forger vs. detective** game — one makes fakes, the other catches them.  
- Diffusion: Like sculpting — start with “noise” and refine until an image emerges.  

### Lesson 04
- Prompt Engineering = talking to AI in a way it understands.  
- Chain-of-Thought = making AI show the steps, not just the answer.
